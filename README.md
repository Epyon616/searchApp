# ReactReduxBase

This is just a throwaway application I wanted to build to try and help me figure out where I was going wrong with my implementation of redux-search.

This is not designed to be an all singing all dancing application, that makes assumptions about the way you should do things, this is an ultra simple base application to help me get up and running quickly when building react and redux applications.

If you would like to give it a try please feel free. 

Usage:
```
  1. git clone git@github.com:StlthyLee/reactReduxBase.git
  2. cd reactReduxBase
  3. npm install
  4. npm run start
```
